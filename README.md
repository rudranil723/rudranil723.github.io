Hello, my name is Rudranil Shil. I'm from Jalpaiguri, West Bengal, India.

I am a student developer and designer. It's been a year since I am in this field, I am on a self-taught journey to become a professional software Developer. I believe my experience has taught me several technological and social skills needed to work in this internet world.

I'm really happy to be on this road and welcome all the new challenges and triumphs ahead. The comradery in the developer community is amazing to me. It keeps me motivated to work out problems when I'm completely stuck. My time and energy are dedicated to learning more and progressing each day to achieve my goal of being a dependable and knowledgeable software-developer with whome clients and development teams, companies want to work with and hire.
